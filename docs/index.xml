      <description>Learning objectives In this introductory unit you will learn the basics of MATLAB, from how to start MATLAB through to how to use it to write simple code and to use basic graphic capabilities of MATLAB. The aim of this unit is for you to acquire a familiarity with MATLAB and to learn a few basic commands.
When you see things written in typewriter font as in this for example, you should type these commands into the MATLAB command window.</description>

      <description>A pre-requisite for the course is to have the program MATLAB installed on your computer. You will only need the basic version of MATLAB for this course. As you will discover there are many toolboxes are available which extend the functionality of MATLAB but these are not needed for this course. In this section we will get MATLAB set up on your computer.
Checking for MATLAB If you are using a departmental computer then MATLAB may already have been installed for you.</description>

      <description>Windows   Expand for Windows instructions    In the File Explorer, right-click and select &amp;lsquo;New&amp;rsquo; then &amp;lsquo;Folder&amp;rsquo;, and call this new folder &amp;lsquo;MatlabCourse&amp;rsquo;. To start MATLAB click on the &amp;lsquo;MATLAB&amp;rsquo; icon, and change the &amp;lsquo;Current Directory&amp;rsquo; to the one you just created. You may wish to create some appropriately named sub-directories to store separately the files from each unit of the course, for example &amp;lsquo;Unit1&amp;rsquo;.    macOS   Expand for macOS instructions    In Finder, right-click and select &amp;lsquo;New&amp;rsquo; then &amp;lsquo;Folder&amp;rsquo;, and call this new folder &amp;lsquo;MatlabCourse&amp;rsquo;.</description>
