## Problem definition

Consider systems of first order equations of the form
`$$ \frac{dy_1}{dx} = f_1(x,y_1,y_2) \,, $$`
`$$ \frac{dy_2}{dz} = f_2(x,y_1,y_2) \,, $$`
subject to conditions `$y_1(x_0)=y_{1_0}$` and `$y_2(x_0)=y_{2_0}$`.
This type of problem is known as an Initial Value Problem (IVP).
In order to solve these we use the inbuilt MATLAB commands `ode45` and `ode15s`, both of which use the same syntax so that once you can use one you can use the other.
(There is a larger family of ODE solvers that use the same syntax. See `doc ode45` for a full list.).

This family of solvers is based on multi-step methods such as Rungeâ€“Kutta schemes, which extend the Euler methods discussed in the previous section.
For more details, see any book on numerical methods of solving differential equations or https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Runge-KuttaMethod.html.
(Note that this is beyond the scope of this present course.)
Use `doc ode45` to find more details on these solvers.

In this section we will demonstrate how to use the inbuilt MATLAB ODE solvers such as `ode45`.
We will demonstrate how this works through two walkthroughs: a single first-order ODE and a coupled system of first-order ODEs.


## Matlab commands

We wish to solve
`$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y) $$`
subject to `$y(x_0) = y_0$`, for given values `$x_0$` and `$y_0$`.

Use of the inbuilt MATLAB ODE solvers requires the following steps:

1. We construct a function (here called deriv) which has input arguments `$x$` and `$y$` and returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$`, that is `$f(x,y)$`.

2. We call the ODE solver (here `ode45`) using the following command

    ```matlab
    [x,y] = ode45(@deriv,[x0,x1],y0);
    ```

    The variables and parameters passed to the ODE solver are:

    - `@deriv !nc`, a handle to a function that returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for a given `$x$` and `$y$`;

    - `[x0,x1] !nc`, the range of `$x$` for which the problem is to be solved; and

    - `y0 !nc`, the initial condition for `$y$`, `$ y(x_0)=y_0$`.

3. We plot the results, which are now stored as `$x$` and `$y$`.


### Walkthrough - Single ODE

Suppose we wish to solve

`$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = xy \,,$$`

subject to `$y(0) = 1$`

using the Matlab solver `ode45`.

Example code to solve this is given by

```matlab
% Function to solve dydx=xy.
function SolveSimple(y0)
    [x,y] = ode45(@deriv,[0,1],y0);
    plot(x,y,'b-x');
    % A function defining the derivative
    function dydx = deriv(x,y)
        dydx = x*y;
    end
end
```

The main elements of this code are

- `[x,y] = ode45(@deriv,[0,1],y0); !nc`
Which is the call to the ode45 solver, whose parameters are:

    - `@deriv !nc` a handle to a function that returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` given `$x$` and `$y$`;

    - `[0,1] !nc` the range for which the problem is to be solved; and

    - `y0 !nc` the initial condition for `$y$`, `$y(0)=y_0$` (where `$y_0$` is a number).

- `function dydx = deriv(x,y) !nc`
which is a function that returns the value of `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for a given `$x$` and `$y$` (here `$xy$`).

Running the code, by saving in a file named `SolveSimple.m` and executing it with `SolveSimple(1)`, yields the following plot:

![ode45 example](/ScientificComputingInMatlab/images/unit_05/5_08_1.svg?classes=matlab-screenshot-40)

This is plotted against the exact solution `$y=e^{\frac{x^2}{2}}$`, in the next figure:

![ode45 vs exact](/ScientificComputingInMatlab/images/unit_05/5_08_2.svg?classes=matlab-screenshot-40)

The red line represents the actual solution and the blue crosses show the numerical solution from ode45.

You can also use `ode45` to solve systems of first-order ODEs (and also higher-order equations by reducing them to systems of first-order equations) as shown in the following walkthrough.


### Walkthrough - Coupled systems of equations

Suppose we wish to solve
`$$ \frac{dy_1}{dx} = -y_2 $$`
`$$ \frac{dy_2}{dx} = y_1 $$`
subject to `$y_1(0) = 1$` and `$y_2(0) = 0$`.

Example code to solve this is given by

```matlab
% Function to solve the simple coupled ODE system.
function SolveCoupled()
    y10=1; y20=0;
    [x,Y] = ode45(@coupled,[0,5],[y10;y20]);
    %
    plot(x,Y(:,1),'b',x,Y(:,2),'r');
    legend('y_1','y_2')
    %
    function dYdt = coupled(x,Y)
        dYdt=[-Y(2);Y(1)];
    end
end
```

This code is very similar to the code for the single ODE but here `Y !nc` and `dYdt !nc` are now vectors.

The main elements of this code are

- `[x,Y] = ode45(@coupled,[0,5],[y10;y20]); !nc`
    which is the call to the `ode45` solver, the various parameters are:

    - `@coupled !nc`, a handle to a function that returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for given `$x$` and `$y=(y1,y2)$`;

    - `[0,5] !nc`, the range for which the problem is to be to solved;

    - `[y10;y20] !nc`, the initial conditions for `$y1$` and `$y2$`; and

- `Y !nc`, the solution in the form of a matrix, in which the first column is the solution for `$y_1$` and the second is the solution for `$y_2$`.

- `function dYdx = coupled(x,Y) !nc` which is a function that returns the value of `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for a given `$x$` and `$\mathbf{y}$`.
    Note that this is now a vector.

- `plot(x,Y(:,1),'b',x,Y(:,2),'r'); !nc`
    which plots the solutions for `$y_1$` and `$y_2$`, in blue and red respectively.

Running the code, by saving in a file named `SolveCoupled.m` and executing it with `SolveCoupled()`, yields the following plot:

![ode45 coupled system](/ScientificComputingInMatlab/images/unit_05/5_08_3.svg?classes=matlab-screenshot-40)

Which agrees with the analytical solution of `$y_1=\cos(x)$` and `$y_2=\sin(x)$` calculated earlier.
