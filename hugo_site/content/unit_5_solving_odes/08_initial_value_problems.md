## Problem definition  

Consider systems of first order equations of the form  
`$$ \frac{dy_1}{dx} = f_1(x,y_1,y_2) \,, $$`  
`$$ \frac{dy_2}{dz} = f_2(x,y_1,y_2) \,, $$`  
subject to conditions `$y_1(x_0)=y_{1_0}$` and `$y_2(x_0)=y_{2_0}$`. This type of problem is known as an Initial Value Problem (IVP). In order to solve these we use the inbuilt MATLAB commands `ode45` and `ode15s`, both of which use the same syntax so that once you can use one you can use the other. (There is a larger family of ODE solvers that use the same syntax. See `doc ode45` for a full list.). This family of solvers is based on multi-step methods such as Rungeâ€“Kutta schemes, which extend the Euler methods discussed in the previous section. For more details, see any book on numerical methods of solving differential equations or http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Runge-KuttaMethod.html. (Note that this is beyond the scope of this present course.) Use `doc ode45` to find more details on these solvers.  

In this section we will demonstrate how to use the inbuilt MATLAB ODE solvers such as `ode45`. We will demonstrate how this works through two walkthroughs: a single first-order ODE and a coupled system of first-order ODEs. 


## Matlab commands  

We wish to solve  
`$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y) $$``  
subject to `$y(x_0) = y_0$`, for given values `$x_0$` and `$y_0$`.  

Use of the inbuilt MATLAB ODE solvers requires the following steps:  

1. We construct a function (here called deriv) which has input arguments `$x$` and `$y$` and returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$`, that is `$f(x,y)$`.  

2. We call the ODE solver (here `ode45`) using the following command  

```matlab
[x,y] = ode45(@deriv,[x0,x1],y0);
```  

The variables and parameters passed to the ODE solver are:  

- `@deriv`, a handle to a function that returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for a given `$x$` and `$y$`;  

- `[x0,x1]`, the range of `$x$` for which the problem is to be solved; and  

- `y0`, the initial condition for `$y$`,`$ y(x_0)=y_0$`.  

3. We plot the results, which are now stored as `$x$` and `$y$`.  

This is shown in the following walkthrough example.


## Walkthrough - Single ODE  

Suppose we wish to solve  

`$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = xy \,,$$`  

subject to `$y(0) = 1$`  

using the Matlab solver `ode45`.  

Example code to solve this is given by  

```matlab
% Function to solve dydx=xy.
function SolveSimple(y0)
%
[x,y] = ode45(@deriv,[0,1],y0);
%
plot(x,y,'b-x');
%
function dydx = deriv(x,y)
%
dydx = x*y;
```

The main elements of this code are  

- `[x,y] = ode45(@deriv,[0,1],y0);`  
Which is the call to the ode45 solver, whose parameters are:

    - `@deriv` a handle to a function that returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` given `$x$` and `$y$`;  

    - `[0,1]` the range for which the problem is to be solved; and  

    - `y0` the initial condition for `$y$`, `$y(0)=y_0$` (where `$y_0$` is a number).  

- `function dydx = deriv(x,y)`  
which is a function that returns the value of `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for a given `$x$` and `$y$` (here `$xy$`).  

Running the code, using SolveSimple(1), yields the following plot 

![TODO REPLACE ME](/ScientificComputingInMatlab/images/1_5_doc_fft.png?classes=matlab-screenshot)  

This is plotted against the exact solution `$y=e^{\frac{x^2}{2}}$`, in the next figure.

The red line represents the actual solution and the blue crosses show the numerical solution from ode45.  

You can also use `ode45` to solve systems of first-order ODEs (and also higher-order equations by reducing them to systems of first-order equations) as shown in the following walkthrough.  



## Walkthrough - Coupled systems of equations  

Suppose we wish to solve  
`$$ \frac{dy_1}{dx} = -y_2 $$`  
`$$ \frac{dy_2}{dx} = y_1 $$`  
subject to `$y_1(0) = 1$` and `$y_2(0) = 0$`.  

Example code to solve this is given by  

```matlab
% Function to solve the simple coupled ODE system.
function SolveCoupled()
%
y10=1; y20=0;
%
[x,Y] = ode45(@coupled,[0,5],[y10;y20]);
%
plot(x,Y(:,1),'b',x,Y(:,2),'r');
legend('y_1','y_2')
%
function dYdt = coupled(x,Y)
%
dYdt=[-Y(2);Y(1)];
```  

This code is very similar to the code for the single ODE but here `Y` and `dYdt` are now vectors.  

The main elements of this code are  

- `[x,Y] = ode45(@coupled,[0,5],[y10;y20]);`  
which is the call to the `ode45` solver, the various parameters are:  

    - `@deriv`, a handle to a function that returns the value of the derivative `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for given `$x$` and `$y=(y1,y2)$`;  

    - `[0,5]`, the range for which the problem is to be to solved;  

    - `[y10;y20]`, the initial conditions for `$y1$` and `$y2$`; and  

    - `Y`, the solution in the form of a matrix, in which the first column is the solution for `$y_1$` and the second is the solution for `$y_2$`.  

- `function dYdx = deriv(x,Y)`  
which is a function that returns the value of `$\frac{dy}{dx}$` for a given `$x$` and `$\mathbf{y}$`.  
Note that this is now a vector.  

- `plot(x,Y(:,1),'b',x,Y(:,2),'r');`  
which plots the solutions for `$y_1$` and `$y_2$`, in blue and red respectively.  

Running the code using `SolveCoupled` yields the following plot  

![TODO REPLACE ME](/ScientificComputingInMatlab/images/1_5_doc_fft.png?classes=matlab-screenshot)  

Which agrees with the analytical solution of `$y_1=\cos(x)$` and `$y_2=\sin(x)$` calculated earlier.
